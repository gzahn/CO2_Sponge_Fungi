# CO2_Sponge_Fungi

Collaboration with Valerio Mazzella and Laura NÃºnez Pons 

Fungal ITS1 sequences were obtained from 4 marine sponge species: 
  - *Petrosia ficiformis*
  - *Chondrosia reniformis* 
  - *Chondrilla nucula* 
  - *Crambe crambe*

This research project deals with the adaptation of sponges to ocean acidification in natural CO2 vents in the Mediterranean Ocean.
